Hey there! I'm Lachlan Campbell, or [@lachlanjc](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc). Though I'm still in middle school, I passionately design and build apps for the web, such as [Noodles](http://www.getnoodl.es/). I'm currently an intern at [Highrise](https://highrisehq.com/).

Check out my [Portfolio](/portfolio) as well.
