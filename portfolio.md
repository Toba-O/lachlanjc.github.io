Over the last year I’ve worked on a number of ideas of mine. Through my adventures come a few projects — check them out below.

## Noodles
Noodles is an app for you to save, cook, and share your recipes. I released it as my first app in November, 2014. Built with Rails, React, and [a few other things](http://stackshare.io/noodles/noodles).

## Helpful
Helpful is a beautiful and simple support tool I helped build on [Assembly](http://assembly.com). “Help shouldn't hurt” &mdash; Helpful is designed to be fast and straightforward to use. I released it along with some teammates in the summer of 2014. Built on Rails.

## Whiteboard
Whiteboard is an in-progress Ruby gem I'm working on with [@nbashaw](https:/twitter.com/nbashaw). It's the fastest way to start building new Rails apps.
