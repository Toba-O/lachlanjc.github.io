## Collections

If you've got a lot of soup recipes, salads, or anything else, you can now create a collection for them in Noodles to keep them together.

To create one, click the new "Collections" link in the navigation at the top of Noodles. You can add a title, description, and even a background photo.

Here's how they look:

To add a recipe to a collection, click the new "Add to Collection" button at the bottom of your recipe. Then, click on the collections you want the recipe to be in:

## PDF Export

You can now export a PDF of any recipe on Noodles. To do so, click "Share" at the bottom of your recipe, then click on "Download PDF."

## Embed

If you have a website or food blog, this is a fantastic way to link to recipes. You can now embed any Noodles recipe right on your page with one quick line of code. To get your code, click on "Share" at the bottom of your recipe, and click "Embed on the Web."

![share-embed.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/26255?token=dk6X51cQOLkrpGtZ5K5_SlbuczJs7wUsLc6EBmlZZ5B4UJ1p5m1KAS-ZBTOqnQVH9jipSD1NdfjDkDI55clC_F4)

Then paste that code on your website, in the HTML. If you want to play with the embeds, check out [CodePen](http://codepen.io).

Here are some examples of what the embeds look like:

## Real-time Search

Over the past week I've been re-engineering some core parts of Noodles, such as the recipe list. This allowed me to make search real-time: as you type, you see search results instantly. You can even search the recipes in a collection!

![turbo-search.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/26397?token=8O1ldgrUSUgBg_BaZvOrwwo5dx7--xqIettN8aI8sZopSMy5ccsHTVja_OB7KWFtNpMY_ljvY3O2FgGrtHdBJTM)

## Favorite recipes super quickly

Previously you had to edit the recipe in order to favorite it. I disliked that, so I added a simple star at the right of the recipe:

![favorite-turbo.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/26363?token=8fvzU5QNpslTi7UuoUlZHoEzDLVKZdjZIWWAv4uMukw22SEplisYDJM75cMH8EmmGbLz2qBy2SeANi34rliHzRA)

Click it, and your recipe is favorited. Click it again to unfavorite. Much faster and more useful.
