## Ingredient checklists

There’s a French phrase, [mise en place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), which refers to the preparation of all your ingredients before starting to cook. Doing a mise en place with Cook Mode is now much easier — there are checkboxes next to every ingredient. Click or tap an ingredient or the checkbox to cross it out, tap again to bring it back. Nothing is saved with the recipe, so each time you cook you'll get a fresh start.

Here it is in action:

## What should you remember next time?

Each time you prepare a recipe you gain experience with it, so I’ve made remembering your tricks and refinements easy.

Now, the last card in Cook Mode looks like this:

But of course, extra notes won't help if you don't look at them again. You can now see your notes underneath the ingredients in Cook Mode:

## Markdown for Notes

If something **really** went wrong, emphasize it in your notes with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). If you haven't used Markdown before, it's an easy method of formatting with simple syntax. For example, typing `**bold**` results in **bold**. Learn more about Markdown [over here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

The Markdown in Notes renders just as you'd expect:

## Cook Mode on mobile

Use Cook Mode elegantly on your phone or tablet, with cards and contents sized/stacked properly.

## Random recipe

When you can't decide what to make, click the lightning bolt on your recipes page to open up a random recipe. Brownies for dinner are not recommended :)

## Design improvements
Across the whole app I've made some nice improvements to the design, such as photos. Here's a quick peek:
