Hey! Iâ€™m [@lachlanjc](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc), a human that likes to design and hack apps. I'm into Rails, SCSS, efficiency, and typography. [Noodles](http://www.getnoodl.es/) is my latest project, a simple cooking app.

With time, this blog will fill with thoughts (mainly on design), code (snippets, tutorials, and tales of crap I dared to ventured into), ideas (you know, if I have any), and perhaps a few interviews. My next post will probably detail what went into building this blog.

Enjoy!
