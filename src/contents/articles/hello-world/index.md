Hello world! Iâ€™m [@lachlanjc](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc), a middle schooler who likes to design and hack apps like [Noodles](http://www.getnoodl.es/). I spent an hour and built this blog with [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). It's hosted with [GitHub Pages](http://github.io/). With time this blog will become full of thoughts, tutorials, and ideas.

Enjoy.
