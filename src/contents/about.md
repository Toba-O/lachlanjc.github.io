Hey! I'm Lachlan Campbell (or @lachlanjc). While I'm still in middle school, I'm into designing and building apps. As of now I'm working on [Noodles](http://www.getnoodl.es), an app I built to help everyone cook better.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lachlanjc/), see my open source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lachlanjc/), or check out some work on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/lachlanjc/). If you need to contact me directly, send me an [email](mailto:lachlan.campbell@icloud.com).
